        Hello.

        I'm Nex.

        I am a 17 year old transgender woman.

        I enjoy programming, writing little programs that do cool things and look cool.

        I enjoy playing games, especially creative/sandbox-esque games, such as Minecraft
        and Space Engineers.

        Evidently, I like creating things.

        I like creating things that I can share with other people.

        I like creating things that will help other people.

        I like creating things because I like to see people smile.

        I like creating things because I want to be the reason someone's shitty day is slightly
        more bearable.

        I don't receieve any sort of financial backing, it is purely out of the kindness of my heart.

        ---

        Ever since I was in primary school, I have been regarded as polite, a pleasure to be around, a role model,
        other similar sentiments.

        I have commonly been praised as an ideal student and even occasionally an ideal member of society.

        I don't do anything illegal and I am not anti-social, as is the common label given to people around my age.

        I am friends with many people who have all said they struggle to see why anyone would not like me.

        ---

        Yet, for some reason, as soon as I go outside wearing a skirt, I'm some sort of freak?
        If I went outside wearing subtle makeup, I'm a creep?

        For some reason, when I don't want to be called by the name on my birth certificate, its an "unreasonable
        request", and I should just "shut up and deal with it", because "we already know you as a different name"?

        When I asked to be called a girl and referred to using she/her pronouns, that's a "massive task", because
        I "still look like a boy" (despite the fact that when I try to not look like a boy I get threats on buses)?

        *For some reason, as soon as someone finds out I am transgender, all of my good will goes to waste?*

        I am a person too. As I've said before. I am just like you; I have hobbies, I like things, I dislike other
        things, I like going camping, I don't like sports, I love to watch movies every now and again,
        I enjoy going out in the summer while the sun is setting, I hate how bad the public transport is, etc.

        But for some reason, __I [must be eradicated](/trans.mp4)__ (see below)
        because I feel like I'm in the wrong body?
        *How does that make sense?*
